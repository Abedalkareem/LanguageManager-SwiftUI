## Usage

First of all, remember to add the ```Localizable.strings``` to your project, after adding the ```Localizable.strings``` file, select it then go to file inspector and below localization press localize, after that go to ```PROJECT > Localisation```  then add the languages you want to support (Arabic for example), dialog will appear to ask you which resource file you want to localize, select just the ```Localizable.strings``` file. <br> ¬†<br>
Now, add a ```Text``` view and then add a text to it, for example ```"Hello !"```, then go to your ```Localizable.strings``` file expand it, you will find Localizable strings file for English and Arabic, for English enter this line with the string you used in the ```Text``` view that we just mentioned before   <br>
```"Hello !" = "Hello !";```  <br>
and for Arabic file :  <br>
```"Hello !" = "ŸÖÿ±ÿ≠ÿ®ÿß !";```  <br>


<br>

After that in you need to wrap your main view with ```LanguageManagerView``` and pass the default language that your app will run first time

```swift
@main
struct ExampleApp: App {
  var body: some Scene {
    WindowGroup {
      // The default language when the app starts for the first time.
      // it can be the `deviceLanguage`, `ar`, `en`, or any language.
      LanguageManagerView(.deviceLanguage) {
        AppView()
          .transition(.slide) // The animation that will be happening when the language change.
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If you want to change the language you should change the ```selectedLanguage``` as below

```swift
struct LangaugeView: View {
  
  // MARK: - Properties
  
  @EnvironmentObject var languageSettings: LanguageSettings
  
  // MARK: - body
  
  var body: some View {
    VStack {
      Text("Select a language")
        .padding()
      Button("Arabic") {
        withAnimation {
          languageSettings.selectedLanguage = .ar
        }
      }
      .padding()
      Button("English") {
        withAnimation {
          languageSettings.selectedLanguage = .en
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
